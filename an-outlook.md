  depending on your prior experience with MATLAB and other programming
  languages.

# Where do I start?

## What describes you best?

### New to MATLAB and programming

If you have no prior knowledge of MATLAB or other programming languages you should start by carefully working through the Crashcourse.

{% page-ref page="crashcourse/a-crashcourse.md" %}

Before you continue with the other material, make sure you pass the self-assessment and solve the applied exercises provided in the Crashcourse.

{% page-ref page="crashcourse/self-assessment.md" %}

{% page-ref page="crashcourse/ols-estimator.md" %}

### New to MATLAB but knows other programming languages

Work through the Crashcourse, mostly focusing on the essential commands section, then pass the self-assessment test and study the applied exercises.

{% page-ref page="crashcourse/essential-commands/" %}

{% page-ref page="crashcourse/self-assessment.md" %}

{% page-ref page="crashcourse/ols-estimator.md" %}

### Worked with MATLAB, but needs a refresher course

If you have worked with MATLAB before, you probably want to try the self-assessment of the crashcourse first and then continue with the programming section of the course.

{% page-ref page="matlab-programming/intro-to-matlab-programming.md" %}

### Comfortable programming with MATLAB

You are probably already familiar with most of the material on this page. However, you might want to browse through some of the material in the special topics section or use this page  as a reference in your day-to-day MATLAB programming tasks - the search function in the top left corner is very useful for this.
