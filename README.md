# An Introduction to MATLAB

## About this course

This course provides an efficient introduction to MATLAB for graduate students in economics. The goal is to give students the tools they need to solve computational problems typically encountered during their graduate studies and research in economics. The course was developed by Lukas Hoesch and Bjarni G. Einarsson and is taught as an optional course at the Barcelona Graduate School of Economics since the academic year 2018/19.

The material on this website is supposed to be a study guide that you should work through along the tutorial lectures. The lectures will work through some, but not all of the material presented here. Also, this books is supposed to serve as a reference site that you can use when coding in MATLAB later during your studies.
